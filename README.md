# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's Disease**, using a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**. The models are trained on publicly available datasets and aim to provide accurate predictions based on user input.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:**
  - Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on inputs like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:**
  - Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on features like cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other factors.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:**
  - Detects the possibility of Parkinson's disease based on voice and signal processing features.
- Interactive and intuitive user interface using **Streamlit**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading machine learning models.

## Datasets

- **Diabetes Dataset:** A dataset containing medical records related to diabetes.
- **Heart Disease Dataset:** Features related to heart conditions.
- **Parkinson's Disease Dataset:** Voice signal features for Parkinsonâ€™s detection.
